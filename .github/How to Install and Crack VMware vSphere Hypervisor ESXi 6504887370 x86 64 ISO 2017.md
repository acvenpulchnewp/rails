You will need to create a free account and register for a license key to download the file. Alternatively, you can use a torrent client to download the file from a peer-to-peer network, but this may expose you to malware and legal risks.
 
## Step 2: Burn the ISO file to a CD or USB drive
 
The next step is to burn the ISO file to a CD or USB drive using a software such as Rufus or PowerISO. This will create a bootable media that you can use to install VMware vSphere Hypervisor ESXi on your server. Make sure you have a backup of your data before proceeding, as this will erase everything on your server.

Follow the on-screen instructions to select your language, keyboard layout, disk partitioning, network configuration, and root password. Once the installation is complete, reboot your server and remove the bootable media.
 
## Step 4: Crack VMware vSphere Hypervisor ESXi using a keygen
 
The final step is to crack VMware vSphere Hypervisor ESXi using a keygen that can generate a valid license key for your server. You can download a keygen from various online sources, but be careful of viruses and scams. Run the keygen on your computer and enter your server's IP address and MAC address. The keygen will generate a license key that you can copy and paste into your server's web interface under Manage > Licensing > Assign license. This will activate your VMware vSphere Hypervisor ESXi and unlock all its features.
