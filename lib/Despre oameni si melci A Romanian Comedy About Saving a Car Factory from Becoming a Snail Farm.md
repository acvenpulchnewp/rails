The film is based on a true story that happened in Campulung Muscel, where the ARO factory, which produced off-road vehicles, was privatized and bought by a French investor who planned to raise snails on the premises. The workers, led by union leader George Petrescu (Andi Vasluianu), decide to take an unusual action: they offer to donate their sperm to a fertility clinic in order to raise money and buy the factory themselves. However, their plan is complicated by various obstacles, such as the corruption of the factory manager Vladimir (Dorel Visan), the interference of the French buyer Robert (Jean-FranÃ§ois StÃ©venin) and his son Olivier (Robinson StÃ©venin), and the personal problems of George and his wife Ana (Andreea Bibiri), who is infertile.
  
Despre oameni si melci is a quirky and humorous film that mixes social satire, romance, and absurdity. The film portrays the difficulties and hopes of the Romanian people in the transition period after the revolution, as well as the cultural clash between them and the Westerners. The film also features a stellar cast of Romanian actors, such as Monica Barladeanu, who plays Manuela, Vladimir's secretary and George's lover; Cuzin Toma, who plays Toma, George's best friend; Valeria Seciu, who plays Tatiana, George's mother; and Clara Voda, who plays Dr. Gina Filip, the head of the fertility clinic.
  
The film was well received by critics and audiences alike, winning several awards and nominations at various film festivals. The film also had a successful box office run in Romania, becoming one of the most popular Romanian films of 2012. The film is available to watch online on Cinepub, a platform that offers free access to Romanian films.
  
The film also explores the themes of love, friendship, family, and loyalty in the midst of the chaotic social and economic changes that Romania faced in the early 1990s. The characters have to deal with their own personal dilemmas, such as George's infidelity and Ana's infertility, Manuela's ambition and Vladimir's greed, Olivier's attraction and Robert's deception. The film shows how they cope with humor, courage, and solidarity, while also exposing their flaws and weaknesses.
  
The film has been praised by critics for its witty script, lively direction, and charismatic performances. The film has been compared to the British comedy The Full Monty (1997), which also dealt with a group of workers who resort to an unconventional scheme to save their jobs. The film has also been seen as a refreshing departure from the bleak and minimalist style of the Romanian New Wave, offering a more optimistic and colorful vision of Romania's recent past.
