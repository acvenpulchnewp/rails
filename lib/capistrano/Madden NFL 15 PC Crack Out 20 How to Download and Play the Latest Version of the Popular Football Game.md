The answer is by using a crack. A crack is a software that bypasses the copy protection and authentication of a game, allowing you to play it without a license or a disc. However, cracking a game is not legal and may expose your PC to viruses or malware. Therefore, you should be careful and use a reliable source if you decide to download a crack for Madden NFL 15.
  
One of the sources that claims to offer a working crack for Madden NFL 15 is [dlpsgame.com](https://dlpsgame.com/madden-nfl-15-free-full-iso/). This website provides a link to download an ISO file of the game, which is a disc image that contains all the data of the game. You will also need a program like uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the file, and a program like Daemon Tools or PowerISO to mount the file as a virtual drive. After that, you can install the game by following the instructions inside the NFO file, which is a text file that contains information about the release. You will also need to copy the crack files from the CODEX folder to the game folder, replacing the original files.
  
Another source that claims to have a crack for Madden NFL 15 is [astucejuegos.blogspot.com](https://astucejuegos.blogspot.com/2016/02/madden-nfl-15-full-pc-game-torrent.html). This website provides a similar link to download an ISO file of the game, along with a keygen that generates a serial number for the game. You will also need to use uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the file, and Daemon Tools or PowerISO to mount it. Then, you can install the game by entering the serial number generated by the keygen. You will also need to copy the crack files from the RELOADED folder to the game folder, replacing the original files.
  
However, before you download any of these cracks, you should be aware of some risks and drawbacks. First of all, downloading cracks is illegal and may violate the terms of service of EA Sports, the publisher of Madden NFL 15. You may face legal consequences or get banned from online services if you are caught using a crack. Second, downloading cracks may harm your PC or compromise your security. You may download viruses or malware along with the crack files, or get redirected to malicious websites that may steal your personal information or damage your system. Third, downloading cracks may not guarantee a smooth gameplay experience. You may encounter bugs, glitches, errors, crashes, or performance issues while playing Madden NFL 15 with a crack. You may also miss out on updates, patches, DLCs, or online features that are available for the official version of the game.
  
Therefore, if you want to play Madden NFL 15 on your PC without any risks or problems, you should consider buying an official copy of the game for PlayStation or Xbox consoles and using an emulator to run it on your PC. An emulator is a software that mimics the hardware and software of another device, allowing you to play games that are not compatible with your PC. However, emulating a console game on your PC may also require a powerful system and some technical skills.
  
One of the emulators that can run Madden NFL 15 on your PC is RPCS3, which is an open-source emulator for PlayStation 3 games. You can download RPCS3 from [rpcs3.net](https://rpcs3.net/) and follow the instructions on how to set it up and configure it for optimal performance. You will also need a PS3 BIOS file and a PS3 game disc or backup file of Madden NFL 15 to run it on RPCS3. However, you should note that RPCS3 is still in development and may not support all games or features.
  
In conclusion, playing Madden NFL
