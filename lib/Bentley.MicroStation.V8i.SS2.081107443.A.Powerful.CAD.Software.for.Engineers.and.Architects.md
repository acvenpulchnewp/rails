In this article, we will show you how to use some of the basic features of Bentley MicroStation V8i SS2 08.11.07.443 to create a simple floor plan. You will learn how to:

1. Set up your project and drawing units.
2. Create and modify geometric elements such as lines, arcs, circles, and polygons.
3. Use snaps and accudraw to draw precisely and efficiently.
4. Add text and dimensions to your drawing.
5. Apply colors, linestyles, and lineweights to your elements.
6. Save and print your drawing.

Let's get started!
 
## Step 1: Set up your project and drawing units
 
Before you start drawing, you need to set up your project and drawing units. This will ensure that your drawing is scaled correctly and that your dimensions are displayed in the desired units.
 
To set up your project and drawing units, follow these steps:

1. Open Bentley MicroStation V8i SS2 08.11.07.443 and create a new file by clicking on the File menu and selecting New.
2. In the New dialog box, enter a name for your file and choose a seed file. A seed file is a template that contains predefined settings and attributes for your drawing. For this example, we will use the seed3d.dgn file, which is located in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Bentley\MicroStation V8i (SELECTseries)\MicroStation\seed folder. Click OK to create the file.
3. In the MicroStation Manager window, right-click on your file name and select Properties.
4. In the Properties dialog box, click on the Working Units tab. Here you can specify the units for your project and drawing. For this example, we will use meters as the master unit and millimeters as the sub unit. You can also choose the resolution and accuracy of your units. Click OK to apply the settings.
